# TSL

TSL is an object oriented numerical library written in C++. The library contains a selection of mathematical routines 
for solving a variety of problems. The linear algebra routines in TSL are powered by the Eigen C++ template library,
Eigen provides fast and reliable solution of both dense and sparse linear systems and eigenvalue problems.
